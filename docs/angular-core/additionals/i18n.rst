i18n
====

The angular-core is registering several i18n keys per default. Have a look at `the default translations <https://github.com/evannetwork/angular-core/blob/master/src/i18n/en.ts>`_ to see, wich translations are predefined, when you are using the angular-core. For more informations how to use translations within angular expressions or how to use the translation service, have a look `here <../services/ui/translate.html>`_.
