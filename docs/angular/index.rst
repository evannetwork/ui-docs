Angular applications using the evan.network framework are build with Angular v5.X and Ionic v3.X. The at the top defined source projects are used, to create simple and structure evan.network DApps.

Within the evan.network wiki, you will find some tutorials with a step by step guide, to develop new angular applications on the evan.network framework.

   - `Angular Hello World <https://evannetwork.github.io/docs/developers/ui/angular/hello-world.html>`__
   - `Angular Task <https://evannetwork.github.io/docs/developers/ui/angular/task.html>`__
   - `Angular Data Contract <https://evannetwork.github.io/docs/developers/ui/angular/task-data-contract.html>`__

**HINT**: The angular libraries are are running by using the `dapp-browser <https://github.com/evannetwork/ui-dapp-browser>`__, `api-blockchain-core <https://github.com/evannetwork/api-blockchain-core>`__ and `smart-contracts-core <https://github.com/evannetwork/smart-contracts-core>`__. The angular version is not using the generalized `ui-dapps <https://github.com/evannetwork/ui-dapps/tree/develop/core/ui.libs>`__ library and is build on Ionic, not using bootstrap stylings.
